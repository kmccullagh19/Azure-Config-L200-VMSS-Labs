1. Create a 2 instance VMSS with Manual upgrade policy. You can do it from portal or use this [PowerShell script](https://github.com/qqnarwhal/Azure-Config-L200-VMSS-Labs/blob/master/buildManualVmss.ps1)
2. Once the VMSS is created, try configuring the upgrade policy to "rolling"
3. For the lab to be considered as completed, all instances must be in "healthy" health state.
